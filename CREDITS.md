## üéØ Why This Integration is Valuable

Each original project solves one specific problem:
- **ChaosEater**: Tests resilience
- **BroCode**: Enables collaboration
- **Infinity**: Trains small models efficiently
- **Arkformer**: Provides production ML training
- **Newton**: Validates correctness

**Together**, they create a complete MLOps platform where you can:
1. Collaborate on model configs in real-time
2. Validate before training
3. Train with proper architecture
4. Test with chaos engineering
5. Deploy with confidence
